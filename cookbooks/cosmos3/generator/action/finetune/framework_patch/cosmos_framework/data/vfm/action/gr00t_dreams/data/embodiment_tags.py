    DEPRECATED: alias for ``JHU_DVRK_MONO``.

    Historically this tag denoted the stereo-camera variant of the JHU
    dVRK (da Vinci Research Kit) surgical robot. Cosmos-Predict2.5 is
    monocular-only (reads only ``video.endoscope_left``), so the stereo
    and mono registry entries were functionally identical and have been
    collapsed into a single unified ``EMBODIMENT_REGISTRY["jhu_dvrk_mono"]``
    spec (see ``groot_configs.py``).

    This enum value is preserved purely for pickle / checkpoint backward
    compatibility (removing it would break pickled training state that
    still holds ``EmbodimentTag.DVRK`` instances). New code and dataset
    specs **must** use ``EmbodimentTag.JHU_DVRK_MONO`` instead.
